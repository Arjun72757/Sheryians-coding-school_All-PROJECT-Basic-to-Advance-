# Sheryians-coding-school_TASK10_Simple-Resume
I have designed and developed my simple resume website using Core HTML and Basic CSS. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of HTML structure, semantic tags, forms, layouts, and CSS styling. I am continuously improving my front-end skills and exploring responsive design and modern web development practices.
